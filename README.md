Prerequisites
An AWS account with access to EC2 instances.
Basic knowledge of Linux command-line interface (CLI) and SSH.
Step 1: Launch an EC2 Instance

Log in to your AWS Management Console.
Navigate to EC2 and launch a new instance using RedHat Linux AMI.
Configure security groups to allow inbound traffic on port 80 (HTTP) and 22 (SSH).
Step 2: Connect to Your EC2 Instance
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Use SSH to connect to your EC2 instance:
bash
Copy code
ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@ec2-instance-public-ip
Step 3: Install Python and Other Dependencies
Update your package manager:

bash--
Copy code
sudo yum update -y
Install Python and pip:

bash--
Copy code
sudo yum install python3 -y
sudo yum install python3-pip -y
Install necessary Python libraries:

bash--
Copy code
sudo pip3 install streamlit newspaper3k pillow beautifulsoup4 nltk
sudo pip3 install --upgrade setuptools
sudo python3 -m nltk.downloader punkt
Step 4: Clone and Configure the News Application
Clone your GitHub repository containing the news application:

bash--
Copy code
git clone (https://github.com/jayanthsaigithub/Service-Oriented-Architecture-Project-.git)
cd your-repo
Edit the Streamlit configuration in your application:

bash--
Copy code
nano app.py
Update the page configuration:

python--
Copy code--
st.set_page_config(page_title='InNewsðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³: A Summarised NewsðŸ“° Portal', page_icon='./Meta/newspaper.ico')
Step 5: Run the Application

Copy code--
http://ec2-instance-public-ip:8501
Step 6: Optional - Set Up a Production Server

Install a production-grade web server like Nginx or Apache.
Configure the web server to proxy requests to Streamlit on port 8501.

Step 7: Additional Configuration (if needed)
Configure environment variables or settings specific to your deployment environment.
Implement SSL/TLS certificates for HTTPS if required.

Step 8: Maintenance and Monitoring
Set up monitoring and logging to track application performance and errors.
Schedule periodic updates and backups to maintain application reliability.

Step 9: Conclusion
Your news application is now deployed on AWS RedHat Linux. Test thoroughly and ensure it meets your requirements before making it publicly accessible.
